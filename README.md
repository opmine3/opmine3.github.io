## Some of the code was copied and pasted from w3schools.

This is the source code for the official OPmine3 website. 
Things to do:
1. Finish main page content
2. Fill out the about page
3. Work on mobile compatibility
4. Fix annoying bugs
5. Finish documentation (for people learning html/css/javascript, like me)
